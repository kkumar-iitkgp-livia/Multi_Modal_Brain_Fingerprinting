We have included 

1. Sample report.txt files (output of featMatchMultiple.exe, feature correspondences) for T1w, FA, T2w (all at 1.25mm resolution)

2. Sample Pairwise Pearson Correlation between rfMRI based fingerprints (Netmats, partial corr - ICA 100, obtained from HCP1200 release). This is similar to Finn. et al. (Nature Neuroscience, 2015) based functional connectome fingerprinting.

3. Sample twin/sibling pair ids. 
   We have: i. cell array row 1: 119 MZ twin pairs;
            ii. cell array row 2: 63 DZ twin pairs;
            iii. cell array row 3:546 full sibling (FS) pairs;
            iv. cell array row 4: 39 maternal half sibling (MHS) pairs
            v. i. cell array row 1: 5 paternal half sibling (PHS) pairs
            
   NOTE: The ids are randomized, as such does not correspond directly to HCP subject list.
