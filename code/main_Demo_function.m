% Summary:
%         1. MATLAB demo function
%           - generate sample plots reported in paper 
%
%%
% Preprocessing required:
%         * REQUIREMENTS: 
%         1. report.txt files for each modality (see below)
%         2. twin/sibling pair ids (numeric id's between 1 to number of
%         subjects/images based on the subject ordering/reading list) for
%         example: MZ sub id set and MZ pair id set etc.. 
%         3. Note: The randomized sample includes pairs of MZ; DZ; 
%           Full-Siblings (FS); Maternal Half Siblings (MHS) and 
%           Paternal Half Siblings (PHS) 
%
%         NOTE: a sample set of report files and twin/sibling pair ids
%         (randomized) have been included in data folder for illustration
%         purposes

% Brief Overview of pre-processing:
%         1. We assume that Bag-of-features (BoF) have been generated and 
%            approximate matching has been performed using 
%            the code available at http://www.matthewtoews.com/ 
%            THE PRE-PROCESSING involves running:
%            i. featExtract.exe for each image (.nii files): output will be
%            .key files containing 3D SIFT features
%            ii. featMatchMultiple -t 2 -r- -n 20 *.key (for all .key files
%            of a given modality): output will be multiple files including
%            report.txt
%          2. report.txt generated for each modality will act as a input
%          for the following analysis
%          3. We have included sample report files (Random permutation
%          applied on our set)
%          4. Note: cross check the file order read in featMatchMultiple.exe 
%           and the sibling/twin pair IDs
%
%%
%  ADDITIONAL processing/files:
%          1. feature match visualization requires 3D SIFT feature files
%          (not included here)
%          2. Significance values (-log10 pvalues) in paper are based on
%          sample size matches using bipartite matching (age-based);
%          However, sample illustration uses random sample size matching
%          3. Similarly hemisphere asymmetry analysis and 
%          pairwise feature correspondence analysis requires restricted data
%          and thus have been excluded here
